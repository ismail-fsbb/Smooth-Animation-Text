# 🔁 Smooth Animated Text Loop (Step-by-Step Scroll)

A smooth, step-by-step animated text effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Each word scrolls up one by one with a soft transition — and loops infinitely without any flicker or jump.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Words are stacked vertically inside a container.
- Every few seconds, the container translates upward to reveal the next word.
- The first word is cloned and added at the end for a perfect loop.
- JavaScript resets the scroll position without the user noticing — creating a smooth, infinite animation.
